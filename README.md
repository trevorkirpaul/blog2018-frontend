# Blog 2018 Frontend

This project is a React based frontend app for a GraphQL Node Express backend. The main focus of this project is to gain famliarity with GraphQL both from the backend and the frontend. Initially, GraphQL requests will be made with a simple library but the long term goal is to implement either Apollo or Relay in order to build a modern and robust GraphQL frontend app.

- [ ] completely integrate all GraphQL requests using `graphql-request` library
- [ ] implement Apollo

## Redux

I will try to avoid using Redux completely in order to focus on using Apollo for everything, especially since it has great client side state management.
